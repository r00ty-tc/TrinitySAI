# TrinitySAI
This is an attempt at creating an open source SAI editor for TrinityCore, such that we can all contribute to it. I know there already is one, but my intention is to put this on the TrinityCore project in github such that all members can contribute.

Some changes compared to the other editor, is that there will be a maintained configuration table in the world database, containing the signature for all events, actions, targets, flags etc. Such that when a new one is implemented in most cases the update to the DB should enable the editor to work with it right away.

I have some ideas, to make the SAI processes more convenient and flow better. But mainly the priority in my mind is to get it up and running such that it works fit for purpose, and cool stuff can wait. This is mainly a bit of a side project for me to see if these ideas I have are achievable.

# Notice
This is not ready to do ANYTHING yet. It doesn't even have a UI or any actual functions for an SAI editor. Don't fetch this hopeing to use it. Continue to use the other SAI editor.
