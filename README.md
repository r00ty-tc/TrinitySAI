# TrinitySAI
This is an attempt at creating an open source SAI editor for TrinityCore, such that we can all contribute to it.

Some changes compared to the previous version, is that there will be a maintained configuration table in the world database, containing the signature for all events, actions, targets, flags etc. Such that when a new one is implemented in most cases the update to the DB should enable the editor to work with it right away.

I have some ideas, but mainly the priority in my mind is to get it up and running such that it works fit for purpose, and cool stuff can wait.
